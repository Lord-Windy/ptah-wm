# Ptah WM 
## Getting Started
1. Install Node
2. Install Webpack and the Webpack-Dev-Server

    ```
    npm install -g webpack webpack-dev-server
    ```
3. Clone the repo
4. Install the dependencies and start the server.

    ```
    cd react-wm
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
5. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

## Future Plans

1. ~~Update the dependencies to later versions~~
2. ~~Strip my resume code out of this~~
2. Refolder my code into the component/action/reducer/container system
3. Change state management to Redux over it's current nothing

   I want the ability to easily save and load states for the 
   browser, and the option to include lost information. Local state
   for objects will remain as needed however, only information needed to
   regenerate the objects will be saved
   
4. Implement local storage (in terms of cookies) to speed up local
   starting of information that can simply loaded at the compile time
   
5. So back to this to see if it makes much of a difference in the
   quality of the code
